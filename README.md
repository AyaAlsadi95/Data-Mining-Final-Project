# Data-Mining-Final-Project


This repository contains my final project for a **Data Mining course**, focused on extracting insights and building predictive models from structured datasets.

Due to academic and data privacy constraints, the full dataset and final report are not publicly available. This repository highlights the methodology, tools, and analytical approach used in the project.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to apply data mining techniques to:
- Explore large datasets
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Build and evaluate predictive models
- Interpret results using statistical and analytical methods

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The project followed a structured data mining workflow:

1. Data understanding and preprocessing  
2. Data cleaning and feature selection  
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Model building and evaluation  
5. Interpretation of results and insights

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python / R (update based on what you used)
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (adjust as needed)
- SQL (if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Techniques Applied

- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Classification / Regression models  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)  
- Data visualization and interpretation

## 🔒 Data Availability

The original dataset used in this project cannot be shared publicly due to academic and privacy restrictions.  
Where necessary, placeholders or sample data are used to demonstrate the analysis workflow.
